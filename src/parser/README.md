# River Flow: The Parsing System

## Overview
The **River Flow Parsing System** models the process of transforming raw code into an executable form using a natural waterway metaphor. Each stage represents a phase in parsing and compilation, moving from the source (raw code) to the ocean (final execution).

---

## Stages of the Parsing System

### ðŸŒŠ **Surface Form (Raw Code)**
- Represents the initial, unprocessed code.
- Similar to how a river starts from its source, this stage gathers input.
- At this stage, the program is just a collection of characters with no structure.

#### Components:
- **Tokenizer** â€“ Breaks raw input into meaningful symbols (tokens).
- **Parser** â€“ Organizes tokens into a structured syntax tree.

---

### ðŸŒŠ **Stream Form (Structured Flow)**
- Code gains structure and meaning.
- Type checking ensures correctness, like a stream gaining direction.

#### Components:
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** â€“ A tree structure representing the codeâ€™s logic.
- **Type Resolution** â€“ Ensures variables and functions are used correctly.
- **Macro Expansion** â€“ Expands macros and simplifies expressions.

---

### ðŸŒŠ **Wave Form (Optimized & Directed Flow)**
- Code is transformed into an intermediate format for better optimization.
- Borrow checking and control flow analysis occur here.

#### Components:
- **Intermediate Representation (IR)** â€“ A simplified version of the code.
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** â€“ Structures the logical flow of the program.
- **Borrow Checker** â€“ Ensures safe memory usage.
- **Early Optimizations** â€“ Basic improvements to performance.

---

### ðŸŒŠ **Deep Form (Low-Level Optimized Code)**
- The program is nearly ready for execution.
- Further optimizations make it efficient and hardware-friendly.

#### Components:
- **Register Allocation** â€“ Assigns variables to processor registers.
- **Aggressive Optimizations** â€“ Improves execution speed.
- **Instruction Selection** â€“ Converts code into specific hardware instructions.

---

### ðŸŒŠ **Sand Form (Final Executable Code)**
- The final version of the program, ready to be executed.
- Code is compiled into machine instructions or interpreted by a virtual machine.

#### Components:
- **Machine Code** â€“ Executable instructions for hardware.
- **Virtual Machine Execution** â€“ Runs the program in a controlled environment.

---

## Additional Elements

### ðŸŒŠ **Tide Form (Metadata & Debugging Information)**
- Stores information useful for debugging and profiling.
- Helps track variables and execution steps.

### ðŸŒŠ **Reef Form (Plugins & Macros)**
- Provides support for extending functionality.
- Handles custom macros and external plugins.
