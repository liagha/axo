# River Flow: The Parsing System

## Overview
The River Flow Concept represents the stages of a parsing system, where raw code evolves through structured transformations, optimizations, and execution. Each stage mirrors the natural flow of a river, from its source to the ocean.

## Stages of the Parsing System

### ðŸŒŠ Source Form (Raw Code)
- Represents the initial, unprocessed code.
- Similar to parsing, where raw input is taken in.

#### Components:
- **Lexer** â€“ Breaks input into tokens.
- **Parser** â€“ Constructs a syntax tree.

---

### ðŸŒŠ Stream Form (Structured Flow)
- The structured version of the code begins to take shape.
- Type checking is performed to ensure correctness.

#### Components:
- **AST Build** â€“ Forms an Abstract Syntax Tree.
- **Semantic Analysis** â€“ Ensures logical consistency.

---

### ðŸŒŠ Current Form (Optimized & Directed Flow)
- The Intermediate Representation (IR) is refined.
- Various optimizations are applied.

#### Components:
- **IR Transform** â€“ Converts AST into IR.
- **Optimization Passes** â€“ Improves performance.

---

### ðŸŒŠ Ocean Form (Final Executable Code)
- The final version, ready for execution.
- Code is compiled into machine code or executed in a virtual machine.

#### Components:
- **Machine Code** â€“ Directly executable by hardware.
- **Virtual Machine** â€“ Interprets and runs bytecode.
