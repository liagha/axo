## Development Stages (River Flow System)

### ðŸŒŠ **Surface Form (Lexing & Tokenization)** (Marchâ€“April 2025)
- **Goal**: Convert raw text into meaningful tokens.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement tokenization rules.
    - Support basic syntax structures.
    - Create an error-handling system for lexing.

### ðŸŒŠ **Stream Form (Parsing & AST Construction)** (Aprilâ€“May 2025)
- **Goal**: Convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Tasks**:
    - Build a structured parsing system.
    - Ensure syntactic correctness.
    - Integrate error reporting.

### ðŸŒŠ **Wave Form (Semantic Analysis & Type System)** (Mayâ€“June 2025)
- **Goal**: Ensure logical consistency and enforce types.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement a basic type system.
    - Perform variable and function name resolution.
    - Ensure memory safety rules.

### ðŸŒŠ **Deep Form (Optimization & Memory Model)** (Juneâ€“July 2025)
- **Goal**: Optimize execution and define memory management.
- **Tasks**:
    - Optimize the IR for performance.
    - Define stack/heap memory rules.
    - Implement register allocation.

### ðŸŒŠ **Sand Form (Code Generation & Execution)** (Julyâ€“August 2025)
- **Goal**: Translate optimized IR into executable code.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement machine code generation.
    - Create a virtual machine or interpreter.
    - Perform final performance tests.

---

## Tooling & Ecosystem

### ðŸŒŠ **Tide Form (Debugging & CLI)** (Augustâ€“September 2025)
- **Goal**: Build debugging and command-line tools.
- **Tasks**:
    - Implement a basic CLI for compilation.
    - Add logging and error tracking.

### ðŸŒŠ **Reef Form (VS Code Extension)** (Septemberâ€“November 2025)
- **Goal**: Provide an IDE experience for Axo.
- **Tasks**:
    - Develop syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
    - Integrate with the compiler and error checker.

---

## Summary
Axo's development follows a structured flow, from lexing to final execution, using the **River Flow Parsing System**. As a solo developer, the roadmap prioritizes essential features first, with optimizations and tooling following progressively. By the end of **2025**, the goal is to have a working prototype with basic tooling support.
