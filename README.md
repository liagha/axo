## Overview
Axo is a programming language named after the **axolotl**, an incredible amphibian known for its **regenerative abilities**, **adaptability**, and **resilience**. Just like its namesake, Axo is designed to be **self-healing, flexible, and highly efficient**.

## Axolotl-Inspired Features
The axolotl has unique characteristics that align with Axo’s language design:

- **Regeneration** 🦎 → Axo has **self-healing error handling**, allowing for recovery from crashes.
- **Adaptability** 🌊 → Axo supports **multiple paradigms**, including functional and procedural programming.
- **Resilience** 🔥 → Axo is designed to handle high-performance tasks and **graceful degradation**.
- **Neoteny (Retention of Youthful Traits)** 🍼 → Axo maintains **simplicity** while enabling **advanced features**.
- **Underwater Survival** 💧 → Axo provides a **robust memory management system**, avoiding memory leaks.

## Key Features
- **Self-healing mechanisms** to recover from runtime errors.
- **Flexible syntax** supporting multiple programming paradigms.
- **Efficient memory management** for optimized performance.
- **Advanced type system** for safe and dynamic coding.
- **Modular architecture** for scalability.
- **Concurrency support** for multi-threaded applications.
