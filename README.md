# Axo Programming Language

## Overview
Axo is an emerging programming language named after the **axolotl**, an incredible amphibian known for its **regenerative abilities**, **adaptability**, and **resilience**. Inspired by these traits, Axo is being designed as a **self-healing**, **flexible**, and **high-performance** language that learns from the best aspects of Rust, C, and Swift while introducing innovative features of its own.

## Call for Contributors
We're building a community of passionate developers to help bring Axo to life! If you're interested in:
- Language design and compiler development
- Runtime systems and memory management
- Standard library development
- Tooling and IDE integration
- Documentation and community building

We'd love your contribution! Axo is in its early stages, offering a unique opportunity to shape a language from the ground up.

## Vision and Inspiration
Axo draws inspiration from:
- **Rust's** memory safety and concurrency model
- **C's** performance and low-level control
- **Swift's** clean syntax and modern features

While incorporating these influences, Axo aims to introduce novel approaches to error handling, adaptability, and system resilience.

## Axolotl-Inspired Features
The axolotl's unique characteristics guide Axo's design principles:

- **Regeneration** 🦎 → Self-healing error handling and runtime recovery mechanisms
- **Adaptability** 🌊 → Multi-paradigm support (functional, procedural, OOP)
- **Resilience** 🔥 → Graceful degradation and fault tolerance
- **Neoteny** 🍼 → Simple syntax with powerful underlying capabilities
- **Underwater Survival** 💧 → Robust memory management without garbage collection overhead

## Planned Key Features
- **Self-correcting runtime** with intelligent error recovery
- **Flexible type system** combining static and dynamic typing benefits
- **Memory-safe** without sacrificing performance
- **Modern toolchain** with built-in package management
- **First-class concurrency** model inspired by Rust's ownership system
- **Interoperability** with C, Rust, and Swift ecosystems

## Current Status
Axo is in the design and early implementation phase. See our [Roadmap](roadmap.md) for detailed progress.

## Get Involved
We welcome developers of all experience levels to join this exciting project.

*Join us in creating the next generation of resilient systems programming!* 🚀
